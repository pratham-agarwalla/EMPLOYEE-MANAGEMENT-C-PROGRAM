# EMPLOYEE-MANAGEMENT-C-PROGRAM

## INTRODUCTION

The objective of “Employee Management System” is designing a scheduling system for a work centre. But these task of scheduling the different activities if manually done whether they may be personal or official is time consuming and also may lead to confusion if not properly scheduled. Employee Management System is a distributed application, developed to maintain the details of employees working in any organization. It maintains the information about the personal details of their employees. It is simple to understand and can be used by anyone who is not even familiar with simple employee’s system. It is user friendly and just asks the user to follow step by step operations by giving him few options. It is fast and can perform many operations of a company or organization. This software project has been developed using the basic C Programming.



## OBJECTIVES

- **Paperless**: To make existing system paperless and save lots of bunching logs of files on the shelf which makes the later on access of the record not at all easy task and overhead to peoples.
-  **Automatic**: Making the existing system fully automatic which will save lots of human resources work. As the current system is all human resource work is needed to maintain and keep the record and details of every employee under and organization to keep track of every employee in staff working in an organization.

## PROBLEM STATEMENT

Manual handling of employee information poses a number of challenges. The use of paper work in handling some of these processes could lead to human error, papers may end up in the wrong hands and not forgetting the fact that this is time consuming. Another challenge is that multi- national companies will have all the employee information stored at the headquarters of the company making it difficult to access the employee information from remote places when needed at short notice. This system will maintain employee information in a database by fully privacy and authority access. The project is aimed at setting up employee information system about the status of the employee, the educational background and the work experience in order to help monitor the performance and achievement of the employee. The program should perform the basic operations upon the database as retrieving, inserting, updating and deleting data. Any additional functionality is a goal of a further module development. It is a kind of strategy to start the development from designing and constructing the database, as this structure will determine the further structure of the application program. The Interface of the program should be user-friendly, and the program should be as easy for use as it is possible.

## TOOLS USED
- Operating System: Linux, Ubuntu or Windows 7 or above
- Minimum requirement:2GB RAM
- CODEBLOCKS

## PROPOSED SYSTEM

The proposed system is designed to eliminate all the drawbacks of the existing employee management software. The system shall be responsible for maintaining information about employees, thus their personal profile.
- Consistent- Every page should have the same header/logo, heading style, fonts, navigations etc.
- Efficient and easy to maintain
- Layout-The layout of each page should have a good contrast between the text and background area.
- Easy to navigate and use- Users should not have a hard time trying to navigate the site.
All these features include the ability to add employee, update (edit), and retrieve through search results. So, this helps in maintaining computerised employee details.

## CONCLUSION
Overall, the system is useful for companies to maintain personal information of its employees. With this system, it will be convenient to easily access the details of a particular employee with his unique employee code. The task of editing and modification of particular data of an employee has been also made easy and less time consuming. This system will save a lot of time and human effort and the details of the employees will be at the fingertips of the management that can be easily accessed, modified or deleted. The system is user friendly with options for most of the tasks that can be easily chosen by the user from the menu displayed on the screen. For further enhancement or development of the package, user’s feedback will be considered.
